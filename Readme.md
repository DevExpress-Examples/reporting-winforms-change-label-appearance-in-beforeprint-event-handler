# Reporting for WinForms - Handle the BeforePrint Event to Change the Label Appearance


This example shows how to handle the `XRlabel.BeforePrint` event, how to access the label object in the event handler, and how to customize the appearance of the label.

> **Note**
> 
> Use [binding expressions](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/403357/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/use-expressions/expressions-overview) instead of the `BeforePrint` handler  to flexibly set values for most of the properties of the report controls.
